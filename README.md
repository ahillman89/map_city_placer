## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have installed the necessary Python packages. You can install them by running the following commands:


```pip install folium geopy```


## Usage

To use the application:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the Python script `app.py` (replace with your actual script name) to generate the `us_cities_map.html` file.
4. Use a web browser to open the generated `us_cities_map.html` file to view the map with the city markers and labels.

## Customization

The application can be customized to include more cities or change the existing cities. Modify the `us_cities` list in the Python script to include the cities you want to plot. The format should be 'City Name, State Code', e.g., 'Reno, NV'.

You can further customize the appearance and functionality of the map by exploring additional features and options available in the `folium` and `geopy` packages.

## License

This project is open-source and available to everyone. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute it as per your needs. Please check the individual licenses of the `folium` and `geopy` packages for more information on using those packages in your projects.
